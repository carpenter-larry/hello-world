# hello-world
first use of github

Hi all,
I am a software engineer.I use C/C++ in windows and linux(Ubuntu).I like linux and coding with diferent languages.
But now I only use C/C++.I will learn other coding languages in the appropriate time.
Now I am working on an embeded linux system.I am interesting in android and java too.

Welcome to exchange whatever experinces with me!
